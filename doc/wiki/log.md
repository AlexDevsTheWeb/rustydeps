# Log

Append-only history. Newest entries at the bottom. Never edit or delete an
earlier entry. See [[index]] for the catalogue.

## 2026-10-14 — Wiki initialized

Created the initial OKF wiki during the scaffolding task
(`doc/raw/2026-10-14-scaffolding/2026-10-14-scaffolding.md`):

- [[index]] — catalogue and knowledge-graph entrypoint.
- [[architecture]] — module breakdown, `PackageParser` trait, and core DTOs
  (`Dependency`, `UpdateType`).
- [[roadmap]] — the six delivery phases.
- [[okf-compliance]] — open formats, licensing, and validation via the
  `.claude/skills/wiki-scribe/scripts/validate_okf.py` script.
- [[log]] — this page.

Also created `doc/raw/rustydeps-spec.md` (core specification) and rewrote
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` for the Rust stack, removing the legacy
React/TypeScript/Vite references.
